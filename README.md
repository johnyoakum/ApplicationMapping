# Application Mapping
I started this project with the intent of providing a more conistent user experience during the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
We determined that we wanted to reinstall as many of the original applications that the user had already installed, during the upgrade process. We search high and low for a low-cost to free solution that helped us map the currently installed applications with the ones that we had available within our ConfigMgr infrastructure. Alas, we only found solutions that would put us above our budget. Out of that desperation came this script. As of now (5/7/2019), there is manual prep work that has to be done in order to create the csv file that is used as the driving home for this script to work correctly.

My goal is to build an interface that will be interactive that will make the process of creating the csv file that is used for the comparison a much more user friendly with a touch of ease of use, but for now, this will have to work.

I do want to say that I am a newbie when it comes to writing powershell scripts, and this was a work in the making. I know it could be worked up better, but it works well and it is only the beginning.

Thanks.

John
